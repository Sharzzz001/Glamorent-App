Glamorent aims at a complete fashion revolution. Itâ€™s an online E-commerce platform that focuses on a user friendly, profitable and reliable app. Making reuse of existing designer clothes at a reasonable and fair price is what most users are accustomed to. It also gives opportunities to budding entrepreneurs to showcase their work and connect to their customers.
The purpose behind this project is very simple. The users can rent, buy or sell clothes depending on their requirements. This not only saves time and money but also makes ultimate use of the product. Besides reusing and re-wearing designer clothes, there is another initiative taken into consideration that is recycling. Upcycled garments are becoming increasingly popular in contemporary fashion industry. This platform encourages entrepreneurs in sustainable fashion.
